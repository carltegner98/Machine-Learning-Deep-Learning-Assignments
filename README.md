**Assignment 1**

**Short Summary**
These projects was developed as part of the compulsory assignment for the course "Machine Learning and Deep Learning" at Copenhagen Business School.
It encompasses a series of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to address a range of machine learning challenges.

**Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Perform EDA on the provided datasets ("listings.csv" and "reviews.csv.gz" for Copenhagen, Hovedstaden, Denmark) to understand the data's structure, detect any missing values, and visualize the data distribution.

**Part 2: Clustering**
Implement a clustering algorithm selected from the course lectures on chosen columns from the datasets to group similar entries.

**Part 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
Apply PCA to the Olivetti faces dataset to preserve 99% of the variance, modify some images with noise (rotate, flip, darken), and compare the reconstruction errors.


**Assignment 2**
**Part 1: SVM and Random Forest**
Predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on the number of impressions on digital marketing channels using SVM and Random Forest models.

**Part 2: Gradient Descent and Perceptron**
Answer theoretical questions related to gradient descent and perceptron learning models.

**Part 3: Neural Networks**
Analyze a network of linear neurons to compute outputs for given inputs and understand the principles behind network computations.
