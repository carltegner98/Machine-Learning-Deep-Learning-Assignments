**Short Summary**
This project was developed as part of the compulsory assignment for the course "Machine Learning and Deep Learning" at Copenhagen Business School.
It encompasses a series of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to address a range of machine learning challenges, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Perform EDA on the provided datasets ("listings.csv" and "reviews.csv.gz" for Copenhagen, Hovedstaden, Denmark) to understand the data's structure, detect any missing values, and visualize the data distribution.

**Part 2: Clustering**
Implement a clustering algorithm selected from the course lectures on chosen columns from the datasets to group similar entries.

**Part 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
Apply PCA to the Olivetti faces dataset to preserve 99% of the variance, modify some images with noise (rotate, flip, darken), and compare the reconstruction errors.
